Hey ! Thanks for visiting my website. I am a PhD candidate at Boston University working with [Pankaj Mehta](http://physics.bu.edu/~pankajm/) on theoretical aspects of machine learning and also practical applications of machine learning for physics and biology. Please check out my research section for a small introduction to some of the projects that I'm passionate about. For more detailed informations or access to the source codes, check out my Google Scholar and my GitHub repository. I'm always open to have an impromptu chat about science and machine learning, so feel free to email me if you have questions or want to discuss.
