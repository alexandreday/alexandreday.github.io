I am a Director of Data Science at [Capital One](https://www.capitalone.com) working on projects for developing frontier ML tooling for production use-cases, which includes techniques such as large-scale graph foundation methods for entity resolution/fraud detection and underwriting as well as GenAI safety methods for vulnerability detections. I'm passionate about building models that actually make it into production.

My background is in computational physics, which is how I originally got into machine learning. These days I'm interested in foundation models for their in-context capabilities (e.g. a mix of tabular/graph/language foundation models) and ways to scale GenAI frameworks in an enterprise setting.

I lead a fantastic team of data scientists who work across business areas like fraud, servicing, cyber and marketing, and a lot of my daily work involves taking good research ideas and figuring out how to make them useful inside a real enterprise system, which usually entails a lot of governance and risk management.

On this site I keep notes, side projects, and ideas I'm exploring. Most of this is intended to not be polished, it is just learnings and ongoing side-of-work interests. If you find anything useful here (or want to chat about ML, science & software engineering), feel free to reach out.

I previously received my Ph.D. from Boston University doing research with [Pankaj Mehta](http://physics.bu.edu/~pankajm/).
